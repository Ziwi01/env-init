# Git

For smooth GIT experience there are some tools configured:

- [LazyGIT](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - great GUI terminal GIT wrapper.
- [diff-so-fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy) - better looking diffs.
- [git-fuzzy](https://github.com/bigH/git-fuzzy) - GIT on FZF steroids.
- `gco` alias for searching and checking out branch with FZF. You can also use it to checkout without searching (`gco branch_name`)
- [Gita](https://github.com/nosarthur/gita) - gather your GIT repositories in groups and execute command on them at once (either GIT command or shell commands)
- [LS with GIT status](https://github.com/gerph/ls-with-git-status) and `k` ohmyzsh plugin - list directories/files and show their GIT status in the terminal
