# About

The idea of this project is to:

- have something consistent when trying to configure new machine, mainly for automation development purposes (like DevOps/SysAdmin thingy), but for general usage also.
- be able to run it repeatably to also update installed tools and customizations to latest versions (or stay on particular versions for stability)
- be easily extendable and configurable to suit personal needs.
- have all the features and usages described so they are easily assimilated for someone new to this, or for someone who wants to improve their workflow and need some ideas.

In the process of making, I figured out that this can be beneficial for all the people who want to learn how to use Linux as their development base. By documenting the tools and [usage scenarios](../usage/10-about.md), this repository can be used by tech-savvy wannabies to get a grip of some advanced workflows and tools, with a little less effort than figuring it out themselves from scratch.

:::note

Below project is an opinionated set of tools which I use for my everyday work, but I hope someone will find it useful after tailoring it to ones needs. All the tools I use will be listed, described and if there are any custom modifications, they will be shown. If you have some new ideas/functionalities/fixes, feel free to create a Pull Request, it will be very much appreciated! See [Contributing](https://github.com/Ziwi01/proveasio/tree/master#contributing).

Please read this documentation carefully. If you feel like it, go through the scripts to see whats going on there before using on existing system.
